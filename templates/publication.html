                        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper provides insight into the
                            performance of portable hand-driven ploughing tools
                            on a maize farm. The focus is on the effect of ploughing
                            blades on the soil and aims to replace traditional ploughs
                            like spades and hoes with hand-driven tools. The goal of
                            this paper is to reduce human effort by showing that the
                            working velocity of the Ploughing tool is four times that
                            of the Traditional Tool and ensure a comfortable posture
                            for the farmer during ploughing while also offering a
                            simple, economical, and efficient solution for ploughing
                            and weed removal. The hand-driven ploughing tool
                            aims to offer a suitable mechanization option for smallscale farmers, providing a solution that satisfies their
                            needs and labor problems. The tool features a ploughing
                            blade with a blade angle and rake angle of 45 degrees,
                            designed to achieve the required depth of cut for the
                            maize farm efficiently. However, it's essential to consider
                            potential limitations or challenges associated with using
                            the hand-driven ploughing tool, such as its effectiveness
                            in different soil types, the physical exertion required by
                            the farmer, and any maintenance or durability concerns.
                            The design and simulation of the plough are developed
                            in SolidWorks.</p>
